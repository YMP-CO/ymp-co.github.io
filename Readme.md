### My Site

**Hello everyone!** My name is Yuri Pushnoy. I am 16 years old and I am fond of computers since childhood. I have always been interested in experimenting with operating systems, firmware and different devices. 

My site is written in **HTML, CSS, JS**. My projects are conveniently collected on it, as well as my social networks. 

### Link: [ymp-co.github.io](https://ymp-co.github.io)

Fonts used: 
- **Fira Code (Google Fonts)**

Also used different libraries on the site: 
- **font-awesome**
- **html5shiv**
- **respond.js**
- others

The site is available in two languages: Russian and English. This is determined through the region code on your device.

**I hope you enjoy it!** I'm not a professional in creating websites, so neural networks helped me.
